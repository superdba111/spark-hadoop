# Project Title

POC Project and templates for Glue developments.

## Description

The Glue Dev endpoint is very expensive and it is best practice not to use it, but to use Glue interactive sessions.

The idea is to use your local computer resource not using dev end point, instead. Therefore we can save a lot of money on AWS Glue services
