Creating a SparkSession
In this exercise, you'll spin up a local Spark cluster using all available cores. The cluster will be accessible via a SparkSession object.

The SparkSession class has a builder attribute, which is an instance of the Builder class. The Builder class exposes three important methods that let you:

specify the location of the master node;
name the application (optional); and
retrieve an existing SparkSession or, if there is none, create a new one.
The SparkSession class has a version attribute which gives the version of Spark.

Find out more about SparkSession here.

Once you are finished with the cluster, it's a good idea to shut it down, which will free up its resources, making them available for other processes.

Note:: You might find it useful to revise the slides from the lessons in the Slides panel next to the IPython Shell.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Import the PySpark module
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create SparkSession object
spark = SparkSession.builder \
                    .master('local[*]') \
                    .appName('test') \
                    .getOrCreate()

# What version of Spark?
print(spark.version)

# Terminate the cluster
spark.stop()

Loading flights data
In this exercise you're going to load some airline flight data from a CSV file. To ensure that the exercise runs quickly these data have been trimmed down to only 50 000 records. You can get a larger dataset in the same format here.

Notes on CSV format:

fields are separated by a comma (this is the default separator) and
missing data are denoted by the string 'NA'.
Data dictionary:

mon — month (integer between 1 and 12)
dom — day of month (integer between 1 and 31)
dow — day of week (integer; 1 = Monday and 7 = Sunday)
org — origin airport (IATA code)
mile — distance (miles)
carrier — carrier (IATA code)
depart — departure time (decimal hour)
duration — expected duration (minutes)
delay — delay (minutes)
pyspark has been imported for you and the session has been initialized.

Note: The data have been aggressively down-sampled.

---------------------------------------------------

# Read data from CSV file
flights = spark.read.csv('flights.csv',
                         sep=',',
                         header=True,
                         inferSchema=True,
                         nullValue='NA')

# Get number of records
print("The data contain %d records." % flights.count())

# View the first five records
flights.show(5)

# Check column data types
flights.dtypes

-----------------------------------------

Loading SMS spam data
You've seen that it's possible to infer data types directly from the data. Sometimes it's convenient to have direct control over the column types. You do this by defining an explicit schema.

The file sms.csv contains a selection of SMS messages which have been classified as either 'spam' or 'ham'. These data have been adapted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. There are a total of 5574 SMS, of which 747 have been labelled as spam.

Notes on CSV format:

no header record and
fields are separated by a semicolon (this is not the default separator).
Data dictionary:

id — record identifier
text — content of SMS message
label — spam or ham (integer; 0 = ham and 1 = spam)

------------------------------------------

from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, IntegerType, StringType

# Specify column names and types
schema = StructType([
    StructField("id", IntegerType()),
    StructField("text", StringType()),
    StructField("label", IntegerType())
])

# Load data from a delimited file
sms = spark.read.csv("sms.csv", sep=';', header=False, schema=schema)

# Print schema of DataFrame
sms.printSchema()

-------------Removing columns and rows---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Remove the 'flight' column
flights_drop_column = flights.drop('flight')

# Number of records with missing 'delay' values
flights_drop_column.filter('delay IS NULL').count()

# Remove records with missing 'delay' values
flights_valid_delay = flights_drop_column.filter('delay IS NOT NULL')

# Remove records with missing values in any column and get the number of remaining rows
flights_none_missing = flights_valid_delay.dropna()
print(flights_none_missing.count())

-----------------Column manipulation------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Import the required function
from pyspark.sql.functions import round

# Convert 'mile' to 'km' and drop 'mile' column
flights_km = flights.withColumn('km', round(flights.mile * 1.60934, 0)) \
                    .drop('mile')

# Create 'label' column indicating whether flight delayed (1) or not (0)
flights_km = flights_km.withColumn('label', (flights_km.delay >= 15).cast('integer'))

# Check first five records
flights_km.show(5)

--------------------Categorical columns------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer

# Create an indexer
indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol='carrier', outputCol='carrier_idx')

# Indexer identifies categories in the data
indexer_model = indexer.fit(flights)

# Indexer creates a new column with numeric index values
flights_indexed = indexer_model.transform(flights)

# Repeat the process for the other categorical feature
flights_indexed = StringIndexer(inputCol='org', outputCol='org_idx').fit(flights_indexed).transform(flights_indexed)

-------------------Assembling columns------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Import the necessary class
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

# Create an assembler object
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=[
    'mon', 'dom', 'dow', 'carrier_idx', 'org_idx', 'km', 'depart', 'duration'
], outputCol='features')

# Consolidate predictor columns
flights_assembled = assembler.transform(flights)

# Check the resulting column
flights_assembled.select('features', 'delay').show(5, truncate=False)

---------------Train/test split-------------------------------------------------------------

# Split into training and testing sets in a 80:20 ratio
flights_train, flights_test = flights.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=17)

# Check that training set has around 80% of records
training_ratio = flights_train.count() / flights.count()
print(training_ratio)

-----------------Build a Decision Tree-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Import the Decision Tree Classifier class
from pyspark.ml.classification import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Create a classifier object and fit to the training data
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
tree_model = tree.fit(flights_train)

# Create predictions for the testing data and take a look at the predictions
prediction = tree_model.transform(flights_test)
prediction.select('label', 'prediction', 'probability').show(5, False)

--------------------Evaluate the Decision Tree--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evaluate the Decision Tree
You can assess the quality of your model by evaluating how well it performs on the testing data. Because the model was not trained on these data, 
this represents an objective assessment of the model.

A confusion matrix gives a useful breakdown of predictions versus known values. It has four cells which represent the counts of:

True Negatives (TN) — model predicts negative outcome & known outcome is negative
True Positives (TP) — model predicts positive outcome & known outcome is positive
False Negatives (FN) — model predicts negative outcome but known outcome is positive
False Positives (FP) — model predicts positive outcome but known outcome is negative.

# Create a confusion matrix
prediction.groupBy('label', 'prediction').count().show()

# Calculate the elements of the confusion matrix
TN = prediction.filter('prediction = 0 AND label = prediction').count()
TP = prediction.filter('prediction = 1 AND label = prediction').count()
FN = prediction.filter('prediction = 0 AND label != prediction').count()
FP = prediction.filter('prediction = 1 AND label != prediction').count()

# Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions
accuracy = (TN + TP) / (TN + TP + FN + FP)
print(accuracy)

----------------------------------Build a Logistic Regression model----------------------------------------------

# Import the logistic regression class
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression

# Create a classifier object and train on training data
logistic = LogisticRegression().fit(flights_train)

# Create predictions for the testing data and show confusion matrix
prediction = logistic.transform(flights_test)
prediction.groupBy('label', 'prediction').count().show()

-----------------------------Evaluate the Logistic Regression model-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accuracy is generally not a very reliable metric because it can be biased by the most common target class.

There are two other useful metrics:

precision and
recall.
Check the slides for this lesson to get the relevant expressions.

Precision is the proportion of positive predictions which are correct. For all flights which are predicted to be delayed, what proportion is actually delayed?

Recall is the proportion of positives outcomes which are correctly predicted. For all delayed flights, what proportion is correctly predicted by the model?

The precision and recall are generally formulated in terms of the positive target class. But it's also possible to calculate weighted versions of these metrics which look at both target classes.

The components of the confusion matrix are available as TN, TP, FN and FP, as well as the object prediction.

---------------------

from pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator, BinaryClassificationEvaluator

# Calculate precision and recall
precision = TP / (TP + FP)
recall = TP / (TP + FN)
print('precision = {:.2f}\nrecall    = {:.2f}'.format(precision, recall))

# Find weighted precision
multi_evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator()
weighted_precision = multi_evaluator.evaluate(prediction, {multi_evaluator.metricName: "weightedPrecision"})

# Find AUC
binary_evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator()
auc = binary_evaluator.evaluate(prediction, {binary_evaluator.metricName: "areaUnderROC"})

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Punctuation, numbers and tokens
At the end of the previous chapter you loaded a dataset of SMS messages which had been labeled as either "spam" (label 1) or "ham" (label 0). You're now going to use those data to build a classifier model.

But first you'll need to prepare the SMS messages as follows:

remove punctuation and numbers
tokenize (split into individual words)
remove stop words
apply the hashing trick
convert to TF-IDF representation.
In this exercise you'll remove punctuation and numbers, then tokenize the messages.

The SMS data are available as sms.

--------------------------------------------------------
# Import the necessary functions
from pyspark.sql.functions import regexp_replace
from pyspark.ml.feature import Tokenizer

# Remove punctuation (REGEX provided) and numbers
wrangled = sms.withColumn('text', regexp_replace(sms.text, '[_():;,.!?\\-]', ' '))
wrangled = wrangled.withColumn('text', regexp_replace(wrangled.text, '[0-9]', ' '))

# Merge multiple spaces
wrangled = wrangled.withColumn('text', regexp_replace(wrangled.text, ' +', ' '))

# Split the text into words
wrangled = Tokenizer(inputCol='text', outputCol='words').transform(wrangled)

wrangled.show(4, truncate=False)

-------------------Stop words and hashing-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next steps will be to remove stop words and then apply the hashing trick, converting the results into a TF-IDF.

A quick reminder about these concepts:

The hashing trick provides a fast and space-efficient way to map a very large (possibly infinite) set of items (in this case, all words contained in the SMS messages) onto a smaller, finite number of values.
The TF-IDF matrix reflects how important a word is to each document. It takes into account both the frequency of the word within each document but also the frequency of the word across all of the documents in the collection.
The tokenized SMS data are stored in sms in a column named words. You've cleaned up the handling of spaces in the data so that the tokenized text is neater.

---------------
from pyspark.ml.feature import StopWordsRemover, HashingTF, IDF

# Remove stop words.
wrangled = StopWordsRemover(inputCol='words', outputCol='terms')\
      .transform(sms)

# Apply the hashing trick
wrangled = HashingTF(inputCol='terms', outputCol='hash', numFeatures=1024)\
      .transform(wrangled)

# Convert hashed symbols to TF-IDF
tf_idf = IDF(inputCol='hash', outputCol='features')\
      .fit(wrangled).transform(wrangled)
      
tf_idf.select('terms', 'features').show(4, truncate=False)

---------------Training a spam classifier------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SMS data have now been prepared for building a classifier. Specifically, this is what you have done:

removed numbers and punctuation
split the messages into words (or "tokens")
removed stop words
applied the hashing trick and
converted to a TF-IDF representation.
Next you'll need to split the TF-IDF data into training and testing sets. Then you'll use the training data to fit a Logistic Regression model and finally evaluate the performance of that model on the testing data.

The data are stored in sms and LogisticRegression has been imported for you.

----------------------
# Split the data into training and testing sets
sms_train, sms_test = sms.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=13)

# Fit a Logistic Regression model to the training data
logistic = LogisticRegression(regParam=0.2).fit(sms_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
prediction = logistic.transform(sms_test)

# Create a confusion matrix, comparing predictions to known labels
prediction.groupBy('label', 'prediction').count().show()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Encoding flight origin
The org column in the flights data is a categorical variable giving the airport from which a flight departs.

ORD — O'Hare International Airport (Chicago)
SFO — San Francisco International Airport
JFK — John F Kennedy International Airport (New York)
LGA — La Guardia Airport (New York)
SMF — Sacramento
SJC — San Jose
TUS — Tucson International Airport
OGG — Kahului (Hawaii)
Obviously this is only a small subset of airports. Nevertheless, since this is a categorical variable, it needs to be one-hot encoded before it can be used in a regression model.

The data are in a variable called flights. You have already used a string indexer to create a column of indexed values corresponding to the strings in org.

Note:: You might find it useful to revise the slides from the lessons in the Slides panel next to the IPython Shell.

----------------------------------------------

# Import the one hot encoder class
from pyspark.ml.feature import OneHotEncoderEstimator

# Create an instance of the one hot encoder
onehot = OneHotEncoderEstimator(inputCols=['org_idx'], outputCols=['org_dummy'])

# Apply the one hot encoder to the flights data
onehot = onehot.fit(flights)
flights_onehot = onehot.transform(flights)

# Check the results
flights_onehot.select('org', 'org_idx', 'org_dummy').distinct().sort('org_idx').show()

--------------------Flight duration model: Just distance-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator

# Create a regression object and train on training data
regression = LinearRegression(labelCol='duration').fit(flights_train)

# Create predictions for the testing data and take a look at the predictions
predictions = regression.transform(flights_test)
predictions.select('duration', 'prediction').show(5, False)

# Calculate the RMSE
RegressionEvaluator(labelCol='duration').evaluate(predictions)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interpreting the coefficients
The linear regression model for flight duration as a function of distance takes the form

duration=α+β×distance
where

α — intercept (component of duration which does not depend on distance) and
β — coefficient (rate at which duration increases as a function of distance; also called the slope).
By looking at the coefficients of your model you will be able to infer

how much of the average flight duration is actually spent on the ground and
what the average speed is during a flight.
The linear regression model is available as regression

-----------------------

# Intercept (average minutes on ground)
inter = regression.intercept
print(inter)

# Coefficients
coefs = regression.coefficients
print(coefs)

# Average minutes per km
minutes_per_km = regression.coefficients[0]
print(minutes_per_km)

# Average speed in km per hour
avg_speed = 60 / minutes_per_km
print(avg_speed)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flight duration model: Adding origin airport
Some airports are busier than others. Some airports are bigger than others too. Flights departing from large or busy airports are likely to spend more time taxiing or waiting for their takeoff slot. So it stands to reason that the duration of a flight might depend not only on the distance being covered but also the airport from which the flight departs.

You are going to make the regression model a little more sophisticated by including the departure airport as a predictor.

These data have been split into training and testing sets and are available as flights_train and flights_test. The origin airport, stored in the org column, has been indexed into org_idx, which in turn has been one-hot encoded into org_dummy. The first few records are displayed in the terminal.

-------------------------------

from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator

# Create a regression object and train on training data
regression = LinearRegression(labelCol='duration').fit(flights_train)

# Create predictions for the testing data
predictions = regression.transform(flights_test)

# Calculate the RMSE on testing data
RegressionEvaluator(labelCol='duration').evaluate(predictions)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpreting coefficients
Remember that origin airport, org, has eight possible values (ORD, SFO, JFK, LGA, SMF, SJC, TUS and OGG) which have been one-hot encoded to seven dummy variables in org_dummy.

The values for km and org_dummy have been assembled into features, which has eight columns with sparse representation. Column indices in features are as follows:

0 — km
1 — ORD
2 — SFO
3 — JFK
4 — LGA
5 — SMF
6 — SJC and
7 — TUS.
Note that OGG does not appear in this list because it is the reference level for the origin airport category.

In this exercise you'll be using the intercept and coefficients attributes to interpret the model.

The coefficients attribute is a list, where the first element indicates how flight duration changes with flight distance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Average speed in km per hour
avg_speed_hour = 60 / regression.coefficients[0]
print(avg_speed_hour)

# Average minutes on ground at OGG
inter = regression.intercept
print(inter)

# Average minutes on ground at JFK
avg_ground_jfk = inter + regression.coefficients[3]
print(avg_ground_jfk)

# Average minutes on ground at LGA
avg_ground_lga = inter + regression.coefficients[4]
print(avg_ground_lga)

--------------Bucketing departure time--------------------------------------------------------------------------
from pyspark.ml.feature import Bucketizer, OneHotEncoderEstimator

# Create buckets at 3 hour intervals through the day
buckets = Bucketizer(splits=[0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24], inputCol='depart', outputCol='depart_bucket')

# Bucket the departure times
bucketed = buckets.transform(flights)
bucketed.select('depart', 'depart_bucket').show(5)

# Create a one-hot encoder
onehot = OneHotEncoderEstimator(inputCols=['depart_bucket'], outputCols=['depart_dummy'])

# One-hot encode the bucketed departure times
flights_onehot = onehot.fit(bucketed).transform(bucketed)
flights_onehot.select('depart', 'depart_bucket', 'depart_dummy').show(5)

----------Flight duration model: Adding departure time-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Find the RMSE on testing data
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator
RegressionEvaluator(labelCol='duration').evaluate(predictions)

# Average minutes on ground at OGG for flights departing between 21:00 and 24:00
avg_eve_ogg = regression.intercept
print(avg_eve_ogg)

# Average minutes on ground at OGG for flights departing between 00:00 and 03:00
avg_night_ogg = regression.intercept + regression.coefficients[8]
print(avg_night_ogg)

# Average minutes on ground at JFK for flights departing between 00:00 and 03:00
avg_night_jfk = regression.intercept + regression.coefficients[8] + regression.coefficients[3]
print(avg_night_jfk)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flight duration model: More features!
Let's add more features to our model. This will not necessarily result in a better model. Adding some features might improve the model. Adding other features might make it worse.

More features will always make the model more complicated and difficult to interpret.

These are the features you'll include in the next model:

km
org (origin airport, one-hot encoded, 8 levels)
depart (departure time, binned in 3 hour intervals, one-hot encoded, 8 levels)
dow (departure day of week, one-hot encoded, 7 levels) and
mon (departure month, one-hot encoded, 12 levels).
These have been assembled into the features column, which is a sparse representation of 32 columns (remember one-hot encoding produces a number of columns which is one fewer than the number of levels).

The data are available as flights, randomly split into flights_train and flights_test. The object predictions is also available.

------------------------------------------------------------
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator

# Fit linear regression model to training data
regression = LinearRegression(labelCol='duration').fit(flights_train)

# Make predictions on testing data
predictions = regression.transform(flights_test)

# Calculate the RMSE on testing data
rmse = RegressionEvaluator(labelCol='duration').evaluate(predictions)
print("The test RMSE is", rmse)

# Look at the model coefficients
coeffs = regression.coefficients
print(coeffs)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flight duration model: Regularisation!
In the previous exercise you added more predictors to the flight duration model. The model performed well on testing data, but with so many coefficients it was difficult to interpret.

In this exercise you'll use Lasso regression (regularized with a L1 penalty) to create a more parsimonious model. Many of the coefficients in the resulting model will be set to zero. This means that only a subset of the predictors actually contribute to the model. Despite the simpler model, it still produces a good RMSE on the testing data.

You'll use a specific value for the regularization strength. Later you'll learn how to find the best value using cross validation.

The data (same as previous exercise) are available as flights, randomly split into flights_train and flights_test.

-----------------

from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator

# Fit Lasso model (α = 1) to training data
regression = LinearRegression(labelCol='duration', regParam=1, elasticNetParam=1).fit(flights_train)

# Calculate the RMSE on testing data
rmse = RegressionEvaluator(labelCol='duration').evaluate(regression.transform(flights_test))
print("The test RMSE is", rmse)

# Look at the model coefficients
coeffs = regression.coefficients
print(coeffs)

# Number of zero coefficients
zero_coeff = sum([beta == 0 for beta in regression.coefficients])
print("Number of coefficients equal to 0:", zero_coeff)

-------------------------------------------------------

# Convert categorical strings to index values
indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol='org', outputCol='org_idx')

# One-hot encode index values
onehot = OneHotEncoderEstimator(
    inputCols=['org_idx', 'dow'],
    outputCols=['org_dummy', 'dow_dummy']
)

# Assemble predictors into a single column
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['km', 'org_dummy', 'dow_dummy'], outputCol='features')

# A linear regression object
regression = LinearRegression(labelCol='duration')

# Import class for creating a pipeline
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline

# Construct a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[indexer, onehot, assembler, regression])

# Train the pipeline on the training data
pipeline = pipeline.fit(flights_train)

predictions = pipeline.transform(flights_test)

# Apply the hashing trick and transform to TF-IDF
hasher = HashingTF(inputCol=remover.getOutputCol(), outputCol="hash")
idf = IDF(inputCol=hasher.getOutputCol(), outputCol="features")
